/*alternative to workshop 4.

In this program you will write an empty
rectangle generator.

The program must have the following 3 functions:

void drawLine(int width); - this function
draws a line of *'s.  The line has width stars
in it

void drawHollowLine(int width); - this function
draws a hollow line of *'s.  This means that it 
draws a single *, then width-2 spaces followed by
one more star.
if width = 5, function draws:
*   *


int area(int height, int width);- this function returns the area of a rectangle
given its length and width.

The main program will use the above 3 functions.  It will 
ask user for a height and a width (both integers).
It will then calculate its area and display it.
Then it will draw a hollow rectangle of that size.
